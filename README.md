# Readme

*Fell* is a tabletop roleplaying adventure game in the new old-school tradition for two or more players, inspired by Into the Odd by Chris McDowall, Cairn by Yochai Gal, and Trophy by Jesse Ross, among many other games.

Herein lies all the rules need to play and run *Fell*, as well as settings and alternative rules for same. Alternative rules will begin with an underscore ("_") followed by the name of the alternative ruleset and another underscore (e.g., [_star-fell_creating-a-character.md](/creating-a-character/_star-fell_creating-a-character.md)).
