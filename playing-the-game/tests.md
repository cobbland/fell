Whenever you attempt a task where the outcome is uncertain and potentially dangerous, learn what could go wrong, then roll a **test**.

Roll your relevant attribute die. Compare the result to the **difficulty number (DN)**, which is usually **4**.

If you meet or exceed the difficulty number, the test passes. Otherwise, the test fails. You might still succeed at the task, but there will be trouble.
