### Spells

To cast a **spell**, you usually must roll a WIL test.

If you fail the test, the spell is still cast, but you must choose one:

- Your WIL is impaired until dawn
- You cannot cast the spell again until dawn

If a spell is aimed at an unwilling target, they may turn your test into a contest.

You can know a number of spells equal to your WIL.
