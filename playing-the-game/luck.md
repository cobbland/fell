When the way in which the world reacts to you is uncertain, the referee will roll a **luck die**â€”usually a d6. Higher is better. Lower is worse.

A luck die may be rolled...

- When you stop to rest in a dangerous location
- If you make a loud noise in a dungeon
- At the start of each exploration and travel round
- To see if a trap is triggered
