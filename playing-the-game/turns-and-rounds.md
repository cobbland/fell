### Turns and Rounds

Time is tracked in **turns** and **rounds**. During a round, everyone takes a turn.

During an **encounter**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a task and traverse a room—about ten seconds. PCs act first and as a group, taking their turns together. When surprised, roll a DEX contest to determine if you can act during the first round.

While **exploring**, a round lasts long enough for everyone to perform a tasks, investigate an area, or rest—about ten minutes.

When **traveling**, a round lasts long enough to traverse three miles of easy terrain at a steady pace—about one hour.

When spending **downtime** in a safe location, a round lasts a week or more.
