**Harm** subtracts from HP. Once out of HP, harm becomes **critical harm** and may lower a relevant attribute.

When you take critical harm, roll a test with the affected attribute and the remaining harm as the TN. If you fail, lower the attribute one step—you’re taken out of the fight and will die without aid.

When an attribute would be lowered below d4 from critical harm, you are **dead**.
