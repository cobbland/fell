### Hirelings

**Hirelings** are non-protagonist characters (NPCs) you can employ to carry your burdens and assist you in your endeavors. Hirelings are created just like PCs. When performing a relevant task, your hirelings may help just as another PC would.

Hirelings take an equal share of any plunder, minus their upfront daily fee. If this fee is not paid in advance, you must roll a WIL contest whenever asking a hireling to do something dangerous.

You can employ a number of hirelings equal to your WIL.
