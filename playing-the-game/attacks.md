### Attacks

To **attack**, roll your weapon's damage die and subtract your opponents armor. Deal what's left as harm—first reducing HP, then dealing critical harm to STR.

When more than one person attacks a single target or when attacking with multiple weapons, roll all dice and use the highest single die result. Then add one harm for each attacker beyond the first.
