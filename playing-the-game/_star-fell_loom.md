The **Loom** weaves the threads that bind the galaxy together. If you can work the Loom, you can attempt to use its power, usually requiring a WIL test, in the following ways:

- **Alter:** Move telepathically
- **Control:** Master mind and body
- **Sense:** Detect and read minds

If you fail the test, the power is still used, but you must choose one:

- Your WIL is impaired until dawn
- You cannot use that power again until dawn

If a power is aimed at an unwilling target, they may turn your test into a contest.
