*The Fell is a seemingly endless highland expanse covered in fallow fields, twisted woods, and putrid moors, with a dormant volcano rising from its heart. Cairns and barrows dot the frigid landscape—memorials to heroes long dead and a time forgotten. Seldom trodden paths snake and shift through the Fell, connecting silent villages and desolate towns, and leading down into the lands beyond—into the misty expanse and towards the smoking mountains on the distant horizon.*

*You're no hero. At best, you're a knave, wretch, or scoundrel who, along with a few untrustworthy companions, seeks fortune in this corrupted land filled with danger. Chances are high that none of you will survive the winter.*

*Fell* is a tabletop roleplaying adventure game in the new old-school tradition for two or more players, inspired by Into the Odd by Chris McDowall, Cairn by Yochai Gal, and Trophy by Jesse Ross, among many other games.

One player is the referee, playing the world and its inhabitants. They adjudicate the rules, make rulings, and describe the situations the protagonist characters find themselves in.

The rest are protagonist characters (PCs), fortune seekers in a corrupted land filled with danger. They ask questions and interact with the environment.

The referee tells the PCs what happens and when to roll dice.

To play, you will need these rules, at least one set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), paper, and pencils.
