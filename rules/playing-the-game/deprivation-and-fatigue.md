When you are **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food, water, warmth, or sleep), you cannot regain HP or restore attributes.

When you are deprived for longer than a day, you become **fatigued** and all tests are impaired. Each additional day you are deprived makes the impairment worse.

You may remove one level of fatigue for each night of comfortable rest on a full stomach.
