When you return to relative safety bearing significant plunder gained through deadly peril, it may be possible to **advance**. If your hoard is worth...

- 1,000 C, gain HP and raise one attribute (novice)
- 3,000 C, gain HP (professional)
- 6,000 C, raise one attribute (expert)
- 10,000 C, gain HP (veteran)
- 15,000 C, raise one attribute (master)
- 21,000 C, gain HP and raise one attribute; fulfill your drive and retire to safetyâ€”or keep seeking fortune at your own peril (legend)

*Alternatively, advance after 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21 successful delves or other prearranged milestones instead of by coin.*
