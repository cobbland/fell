## Creating a Character

Roll for your **name** (page 26).

Roll for a **background** (page xx) and gain the associated **skill** and **equipment**.

You have four **attributes**:

- **STR**: constitution, grit, **strength**
- **DEX**: aim, **dexterity**, speed
- **INT**: cunning, **intellect**, smarts
- **WIL**: charisma, personality, **willpower**

Roll d8 for each **attribute** in order to assign dice:

- **1-2**: d4
- **3-6**: d6
- **7-8**: d8

Roll DEX to determine your starting **hit protection** (HP), a representation of your ability to avoid critical harm.

If your WIL is d8, roll it. If the result is 6 or higher, you can work the **Loom** (page xx).

In addition to the equipment from your background, you start with a **pack** containing **one days' rations**, **three light cells** (1 hour each), and **3d6 credits** (C).

Roll 2d20+10 for your **age**.

Roll for your **drive** and your **traits** (page 27).

*Instead of rolling, you may start with any name, any background or a custom background (including a name, a skill, and equipment worth 40 C), d6 in each attribute (optionally lowering one or more one step to raise others the same number of steps), 3 HP (or 2 if DEX is d4, 4 if d8, 5 if d10, or 6 if d12), work the loom if your WIL is d12, additional equipment worth 20 C, any age, and any drive and traits or write your own.*
