## Creating a Character

Roll for your **name** (see [Names](/lists-and-tables/names/)).

Roll for a **background** (see [Backgrounds](/lists-and-tables/backgrounds.md)) and gain the associated **skill** and **equipment**.

You have four **attributes**:

- **STR**: constitution, grit, **strength**
- **DEX**: aim, **dexterity**, speed
- **INT**: cunning, **intellect**, smarts
- **WIL**: charisma, personality, **willpower**

Roll d8 for each **attribute** in order to assign dice:

- **1-2**: d4
- **3-6**: d6
- **7-8**: d8

Roll DEX to determine your starting **hit protection** (HP), a representation of your ability to avoid critical harm.

If your WIL is d8, roll for one **spell** (see [Spells](/lists-and-tables/spells.md)).

In addition to the equipment from your background, you start with a **pack** containing **one days' rations**, **three torches** (1 hour each), and **3d6 coin** (C).

Roll 2d20+10 for your **age**.

Roll for your **drive** and your **traits** (see [Drives](/lists-and-tables/drives.md) and [Traits](/lists-and-tables/traits/)).

*Instead of rolling, you may start with any name, any background or a custom background (including a name, a skill, and equipment worth 40 C), d6 in each attribute (optionally lowering one or more one step to raise others the same number of steps), 3 HP (or 2 if DEX is d4, 4 if d8, 5 if d10, or 6 if d12), a spell of your choice if your WIL is d8 or higher, additional equipment worth 20 C (see [Equipment](/lists-and-tables/equipment.md)), any age, and any drive and traits or write your own.*
