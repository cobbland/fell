## Playing the Game

### The Basic Procedure

- The referee describes the situation.
- Peasants declare what actions they will attempt.
- The referee describes the outcome.

### Rolls

If a proposed action is risky, roll: 1d20 + an ability to see if you succeed.

Roll with advantage (roll twice, keeping the better result) if the task is something someone with your race/species or background would be particularly good at.

If it is an attack, the roll must match or beat the target’s AC: 10 (or by armor) + DEX. On a hit, roll for damage, which subtracts from HP.

### Luck

When you fail a roll, gain 1 luck. Spend luck to modify a roll for or against you, 1-for-1. Spend 2 luck to gain advantage on any d20 roll. Spend 4 luck to reroll any roll. Once you have six luck, roll 1d4 and that is how much luck you have instead.

### Magic

If you attempt to cast a spell, roll 1d6 plus the spell's level equal to or under your luck. If you succeed, you cast the spell as normal. Otherwise, the spell backfires. Either way, you expend all your luck.

### Equipment

You can carry 10 + STR pieces of equipment. When carrying more, you have disadvantage on d20 rolls (roll twice and keep the worse result). You can never carry more than twice this amount.

### Death

When your HP reaches zero, roll 1d6. If equal to or under your luck, use all your luck to gain 1 HP. Otherwise, you’re dead. Roll up a new peasant.
