## Other Rules

These rules are in addition to the rules of *[Peasant](https://illuminatedsnail.itch.io/peasant)*.

**Advantage:** Roll with advantage if a task is something someone with your class would be particularly good at.

**Class Dice:** When rolling your class dice, keep rolling as many times as you want, or until you roll equal to or lower than 3 and your class dice is impaired. Impaired class dice replenish at dawn after a good night's rest.

**Criticals:** When you roll 20 or 1 on a d20, you get a critical hit or critical miss, respectively. On a critical hit, deal max damage + dice. On a critical miss, your enemy gets to attack you.

**Death:** Instead of dying when you fail your luck roll against death, gain exhaustion.

**Enhancement and Impairment:** If dice are enhanced or impaired, they move up and down this progression: d4 → d6 → d8 → d10 → d12.

**Equipment:**  When carrying more than your standard load, all non-d20 rolls are impaired.

**Exhaustion:** Subtract twice your current exhaustion from d20 rolls and other dice are impaired. Once you reach six exhaustion, you die. Remove one level of exhaustion after a good night's rest.

**Luck:** Spend 2 luck to enhance a roll. 

**Restrictions:** Lose the use of your class dice when breaking the restrictions of your class.

**Rounding:** Unless otherwise noted, always round down, to a minimum of 1.

**Shields & Helmets:** Allow your shield to be destroyed to negate an attack. Allow your helmet to be destroyed to turn a critical hit into a regular hit.

**Spell Saves:** If a spell requires a save, the number to meet or beat is 8 + half the highest face of the caster's class dice + the caster's spell ability (WIS for Clerics or INT for Wizards).

**Two-Weapon Fighting:** When wielding a weapon in each hand, roll to hit once. Then roll both damage dice, keeping the higher result.
