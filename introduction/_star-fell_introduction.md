## Introduction

*The Star Fell is the vast distance between settled systems—a place of lawless wilderness where unknown dangers await. Long-abandoned derelicts float through the void, contents guarded by the silent dead, seemingly free to those who dare brave the hazards of uncharted space. Fueling stations are few and far between. There, ship captains share stories of disasters narrowly avoided and the locations of hidden riches—for a price.*

*You're no hero—not yet. At best, you're a smuggler, rogue, or scoundrel who's teamed up with a few unlikely companions to carve out a living in the most dangerous corners of the galaxy. Though the odds are never in your favor, out here in the deep, a life-changing fortune is always just a handbreadth away—if you know where to look, and who to trust.*

*Star Fell* is modification of *Fell*, both being [tabletop roleplaying adventure games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) in the [new](https://newschoolrevolution.com/the-new-new-school-revolution/) [old-school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Renaissance) tradition for two or more players, inspired by [Into the Odd](https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/into-the-odd/) by [Chris McDowall](https://www.bastionland.com), [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com) by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com), [Trophy](https://trophyrpg.com) by [Jesse Ross](https://jesseross.com), and [Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Roleplaying_Game), among many other games.

One player is the referee, playing the world and its inhabitants. They adjudicate the rules, make rulings, and describe the situations the protagonist characters find themselves in.

The rest are protagonist characters (PCs), fortune seekers in the lawless wilderness of space. They ask questions and interact with the environment.

The referee tells the PCs what happens and when to roll dice.

To play, you will need these rules, at least one set of [polyhedral dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice#Polyhedral_dice) (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20), paper, and pencils.
