I seek wealth to…

1. Pay the ransom demanded by the Pale Bankers, who claim my family’s bones until the debt is paid.
2. Bribe the Church of All-Saints to erase the heresy that blackens my bloodline.
3. Raise a cairn vast enough to anchor my spirit, lest it wander the putrid moors after death.
4. Pay the ferryman of the Ashen Deep so the souls of my family will pass into the realm beyond.
5. Amass a war chest to challenge Baron Rotherbourne, who usurps what should be mine.
6. Pay the Sea-Witches for a vessel cunning enough to pass the mist to the land beyond.
7. Buy a library of forbidden tomes to break the prophecy that dooms my line to betrayal.
8. Restore the thousand bells of the All-Saints, silent since the king’s death a century past.
9. Commission mercenaries enough to scour the Grimmark and raise a keep of my own.
10. Have a blade forged, tempered in Agermount’s heartfire, to slay the wyrm that haunts my kin.
11. Secure a dowry rich enough to wed into House Fellweald’s bloodline.
12. Reclaim my ancestral barrow, now defiled and squatted by carrion-knights.
13. Buy the silence of every bard, lest they sing my shame.
14. Commission a tomb of iron to imprison the restless shades of my ancestors.
15. Build a temple on the moors where none dare tread, to earn the blessing of the one true god.
16. Buy the loyalty of a hundred knights to overthrow the Duchess herself.
17. Purchase my family's freedom from Baron Rotherbourne, who keeps them rotting in his dungeon.
18. Acquire the reliquary of Saint Uther, locked within Castle Fell’s forbidden vaults.
19. Buy ten thousand bushels of seed and plant the blighted fields, growing enough grain to rule when famine comes.
20. Erect a stone hall large enough to shelter the refugees of my wasted barony.
